    <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <p>Some issues pointed out by my users were that my recent mission table wasn't centered with the page. They also said some of the colors and layout could be made more immersive and streamlined. I took everything that I received as like you would with a child I saw no flaws with my brain child but after some consideration I realized they were right and needed to be changed.</p>
    <p>Overall throughout the semester I learned tons of valuable information that I always thought I would never be able to do. Making websites was alwyas something that seemed impossible for me as I had no knowledge of the subject. After taking the course I see that with the right teaching anything can be made out to be simple. I think I was at my strongest when we first started working on CSS but honestly I lost my drive torwards the end of the semester. If I got to start over I would set aside more time for studying and learning and make sure to keep a detailed schedule to help me with dates. If I had to start over I would definetely leave myself more time to finish.</p>
    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is the idea that as websites should be able to be used by everyone who comes to them. This is done by using said progressive enhancement by starting with a solid base layer of html that makes the website work for everyone no matter how fancy they like it to be. Then for your next level of user you add css and that takes the website up another step and allows for more creativity while also not being the cream of the crop of design. Finally you get the JavaScript which allows for your highest end users to have the top of the line interaction with the website and all the things that the internet can currently allow users to do on a website with no restrictions to older search engines capabilities. </p>
    <p>It is important for the web as without it many users would be forced to stop using top of the line websites as they wouldn't be able to access all the high end javascript stuff and would therefore be limiting the world wide web to only a select group of people. Over this year I have learned that one thing you don't want to do is limit the number of people who can access the public content you make. That's why progressive enhancement is so important.</p>
